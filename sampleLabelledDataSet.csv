1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,Designed to work on a slope as a dynamic walker this robot (~45 cm tall) exploits dynamics and morphology (in particular the shape and length of the body and feet) to achieve stable walking,introduction
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The robot’s natural dynamics serves as the target dynamics for a reinforcement learning mechanism enabling the robot to quickly learn to walk on flat ground,knownfact

1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,Inspired by flies this ultralight (60 mg 3-cm wingspan) ornithopter (a device that flies by flapping its wings) generates sufficient lift to take off vertically (power is supplied externally),observation
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,A large part of the control is delegated to the morphological and material 201properties of the robot,perturbation
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,Compliant structures are driven into resonance to 8 produce a large wing stroke and flexible material is used in the wing hinges to allow for passive rotations of the wings,perturbation

1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The bio-inspiration for this palm-sized robot is provided by the gecko and its uncanny climbing talents,introduction
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The robot’s tri-foot (three-footed wheel) is equipped with a polymer dry adhesive material which to some extent has contact properties comparable to those of its biological analog,scientificAction
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The robot can flexibly navigate on smooth vertical and even inverted surfaces,observation
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,(G) Morphing through localized self-reconfiguration (7),toDelete
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,This self-reconfigurable robot is composed of active (actuated black) and passive (nonactuated white) cubic modules (~400 g ~60 to 65 mm side length),observation
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The modules connect to each other through hooks which enables the robot to change its morphology in a large number of ways,observation
1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The picture shows the metamorphosis from a four legged (quadruped) structure to a linear (snakelike) structure,observation

1fl1VovpvPW7vfkLruLp3iP7EaFXYYJWX,The individual wheel-like modules (~10 cm in diameter) constituting this robot are equipped with spokelike parts driven by linear actuators,observation
